# BAS-iOS-App-2025
This is the official Brampton Adult Soccer iOS app that integrates and communicates with BramptonSoccer.com using the BAS LMS plugin.


## CHANGELOG

 = 0.2 =
 * NEW: Setting up a login screen when a user first launches the app, it retains the users credentials for WP because we'll repeatedly need them to fire to retrieve data that should ultimately be private.
 * NEW: Establishing a Dashboard/Home View where we greet the user with a "Welcome Firstname Lastname" message and then we display their upcoming matches.
 * NEW: Clicking on one of the nicely styled boxes for each upcoming match opens a slide up 'Sheet' that gives further match data, like a link to Google Maps for the venue, conversion of the date from `YYYY-MM-DD` to `Day-of-Week, Month, DD, YYYY`
 * NEW: Started building out the profile page by adding the users name, next step will be to add their user photo from their BAS online profile.

 = 0.1 =
 * NEW: Just figuring out the whole xCode/SwiftUI/iOS coding.
